## Daily News Podcasts

I listen to two daily news podcasts:
* [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily) from the New York Times
* [Up First](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first) from NPR

I manipulated one year of episode data for each podcast and created three variables: headline, date, and summary. I am currently working to clean and analyze the data.
